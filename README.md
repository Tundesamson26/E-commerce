# E-commerce Website with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
I create the e-commerce with html, css (grid, flex and flexbox). It's very responsive, display menu bar while on mobile devices.
I will appreciate any contribution and suggestion.
The inspiration was from a YouTube video by Bedimcode but was written by me from scratch.
